      <p>Origninally i fell into IT around 2003 when i started working for different help desks. For around 10 years I began working as 
        contractor for many different big name organizations. Learning what was needed for IT professionals in many large organizations. In 2011,
        I landed my first direct hire job for an organization and within a year i was working as a system administrator for a local governement's applciations.
        Managing applications like exchange, Active Directory, Skype, etc. During this time i decided to go back to school and pusue my bachelors degree. That
        was when i transferred to an Applications Development team and truly fell in love being a software developer. My journey still isnt over, actually 
        its still going on as I try to get better each day. They say the best way to get better is to teach. Here I am passing some knowledge that I have
        to others in the software development community.

      <h2>Introduction to Object-Oriented Design</h2>
      <h5>Design Fundamental, June 17, 2018</h5>
      <div><img src="./Images/code2.gif" alt="Code2" height="200px"/></div>
      <p>Object-Oriented Design is one of the fundamental principles of software development. Practicing these concepts can really enhance your future
        as a Software Developer.

        Let's think about all the different types of candy that are out there. We have taffy, chocolate bars, hard candy, etc. Each of these types, have
        characteristics. some may be chewy, others are not chewable at all. If we think aobut these principles, we can apply that to our code.
      </p>
      <p>Each candy type can be thought of as a class. Thoses classes are going to have properties that are common within them.</p>
      <p>As an example our taffy class:  
        <ul>
          <li>Flavor</li>
          <li>Size</li>
          <li>Chewable</li>
        </ul>
        Are all properties that can occur in this class.

      <h2>Web Technologies</h2>
      <h5>Web Technology Fundamentals, June 17, 2018</h5>
      <div><img src="./Images/mac.gif" alt="Responsive" height="200px"></div>
      <p>Web Technologies is the most fundamental knowledge that we can have for anything on the Internet. </p>
      <p>The Internet is a very large place and with the abundance of technologies out there, where do you start, Ruby, ASP.net, Spring, JavaScript?</p>
      <p>Starting with HTML and CSS can provide alot of foundation for the other technologies as we can dive into them piece by piece. How do we get
        web servers online with hosted material? How do I get that domain name and get search engines to show my site?
