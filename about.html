      <p>Origninally i fell into IT around 2003 when i started working for different help desks. For around 10 years I began working as 
        contractor for many different big name organizations. Learning what was needed for IT professionals in many large organizations. In 2011,
        I landed my first direct hire job for an organization and within a year i was working as a system administrator for a local governement's applciations.
        Managing applications like exchange, Active Directory, Skype, etc. During this time i decided to go back to school and pusue my bachelors degree. That
        was when i transferred to an Applications Development team and truly fell in love being a software developer. My journey still isnt over, actually 
        its still going on as I try to get better each day. They say the best way to get better is to teach. Here I am passing some knowledge that I have
        to others in the software development community.

      <p>Getting to that next level</p>
      <p>In Software Programming getting the basic knowledge can be easy. But where do we go from there. That can be the challenge. How do you get froman1
          Getting that first job with the knowledge that you have attained, to becoming that Senior Developer. But before you can do that, what do you really want to do?
      </p>
      <p>Navigating the development world can be really confusing. Some of the more common job titles include: </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Front-End Developer</li>
          <li>Backend Developer</li>
          <li>Web Developer</li>
          <li>Mobile Developer</li>
          <li>Ruby-on-Rails Developer</li>
          <li>JavaScript Developer</li>
          <li>... And the list can go on</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here at CodeMentor, our goal is get you from Point A to Point B and encompass all the things in between.</p>
      <p><strong>First</strong>, we start with the interviewe prep, resume review and work shops that strengthen the knowledge that you already have.
        We will use common technologies, and monthly projects that we will improve week in and week out to really stregnthen your programming skills. Not
        too mention that it will be nice to have on your GitHub profile.</p>
      <p><strong>Then</strong>, once you have your foot in the door, we will continue to do workshops, virtually or in person, that will continue
        to strengthen your skills. By partnering with our team we can really dive into what exactly your interests are, or the technologies that 
        your using everday at your job.</p>
      <p><strong>Finally</strong>, during this we can have more discussion on what you think a Senior level devleoper is, and look further at job
        descriptions to get you too that level.</p>
      <p>Ready to begin, contact our team and lets <strong>dive in to some great code!</strong></p>
